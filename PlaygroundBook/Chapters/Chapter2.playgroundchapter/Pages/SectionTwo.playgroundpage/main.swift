## Why Dont We Make Everything out of Glass, Extended Bonding Structures
 
 - Most atoms in the periodic table do make bonds to lots of atoms
 - The bonding molecular orbital for hydrogen decreases in energy much more than lithium and rubidium, mainly because of atomic size
 - Making a single sigma bond is only really effective for smaller atoms
 - Most of the elements in the periodic table, including lithium and rubidium are in the large atomic size/make bonds to multiple atoms regions - these are metals
 - The smaller, more electronegative elements make single very strong bonds, they dont need to bond to lots of other atoms at the same time
 
 ![sizeandbondchart](sizeandbondchart.png "Size and bonding periodic table")
 
 - When smaller atoms are close together atomic orbital overlap is strong, the wave function of the bonding molecular orbital is largest, the probability of finding the electrons is largest between the atoms
 - When larger atoms are further apart, atomic orbital overlap is poor, the wave function of bonding molecular orbital is smaller between the atoms, probability of finding electrons between the atoms is low, bonding is much weaker
 
 *Overcoming poor orbital overlap - multi-atom metallic bonding*
 - Larger atoms use a different method to lower the energies of the electrons, they can overlap their atomic orbitals with many adjacent atoms to make molecular orbitals that spread out over many atoms
 - the more atomic orbitals we combine the lower the energy of the lowest energy orbital, the higher the energy of the highest energy orbital(antibonding), and the closer in energy the various orbitals become
 - combining very many atoms and their orbitals together generates many atomic orbitals that have very small energy separations
 - there is no benefit to hydrogen forming metallic structure over making a single strong bond
 - atoms that form mainly molecular structures have electron pairs that are very low energy in bonds between just 2 atoms, there is no need to form extended structures.
 - Atoms form the 3-D extended structures tend to be larger
 
 - Most elements arrange themselves to produce metallic bonding
   - Metal properties
     - conduct electricity
     - malleable
     - luster
     - these properties can be explained in terms of the metallic bonding model
 
 *Conductivity*
 A material conducts electricity when electrons move through a material in response to a difference in electron energies.
 To move an electron has to move into another empty orbital, orbitals can hold only 2 electrons at a time, the empty orbital needs to be very close in energy, as they are in metallic bonding
 - When an electric field is applied the electrons respond and flow to the positive charged end.
 - There must be empty orbitals for the electrons to move into for that to happen
 - There is no electron flow or conduction for the electrons in 1s band, because it is already full, there is nowhere for the electrons to go. Conduction happens for the electrons in the 2s band only
 - Bands that are not filled with electrons are called conduction bands
 
 *Malleability*
 *Luster*
 - A material is shiny when it does not absorb light, when it reflects light esentially equal to all wavelengths, it has no color
 - Physics phenomenon
 - Electrons are very easily moveable in band such as 2s band in Li, they can easily jump from orbital to orbital with almost no energy cost, accounts for conductivity AND reflectivity. Electrons that are easily moveable to be polarizable.
 - Electric field vector of the incoming light induces oscillations in polarizable electrons
 - Oscillating electrons emit light in all directions, especially in the direction least likely to suffer destructuve interference
 
 - Beryllium
 - Both 1s and 2s bands are filled with electrons, you would not expect it to be a conductor since no empty orbitals for electrons to move into
 - But there is a 2p band, formed by overlap of 2p atomic orbitals, and this band overlaps with the 2s band
 - Electrons in 2s band can easily move into orbitals in the 2p band
 - 2s and 2p band essentiall form one large conduction band that can accomadate up to 8 electrons per atom
 - Transition metals have a d band formed by combing d atomic orbitals that overlap in energy with the closest s band to make a composit band that can accommodate 12 electrons per atom.

 - A measure of how strongly atoms are bonded together in a metal is the melting point of the metal.
 - Higher the melting point the more energy is required to break appart the bonds.
 - Melting point of chromium is roughly 1900C where as copper is closer to 1000C
 - how can band theory and metallic bonding explain this difference
 
 ![chromiumandcopper](chromiumandcopper.png "Electrons chromium and copper")
 
 - Chromium has all of the electrons in bonding orbitals, overall bonding is stronger
 - Copper has electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals, overall bonding is weaker.
 
 ## Semiconductors and insulators
 
 - Smaller atoms, carbon for example, tend to form stronger bonds with low energy electrons in the bonding molecular orbitals due to good atomic orbital overlap
 - Larger atoms tend to form weaker bonds with high energy electrons in the bonding molecular orbitals due to poorer atomic orbital overlap
 - The above trends extends to extended structures that are characterized by molecular orbital bands
 - For carbon, just as there is a large separation between the energies of the bonding and antibonding orbitals in the diatomic, there is also a large separation in energy of the bonding and anti bonding bands a *bandgap*
 *carbon example*
 - there are four valence electrons per atom, two electrons per orbital, all the valence electrons go into the lower energy sigma-bonding band which becoms full
 - The bonding band is full, the antibonding band is empty, there is no half-filled orbital, the electrons in diamond are *not polarizable*, they can not move around
 - Diamond is not a conductor, diamond is an insulator, it does not have luster, it is not a metal, bands cause this
 - If electrons could get into the antibonding band they would be polarizable and metal like, the energy they need to get from the bonding to the antibonding band is too large *the bandgap is too large*
 - remember electrons move through unpopulated antibonding orbitals..?
 - the band that contains the valence electrons is called the *valence band*, the higher energy empty band, where conducting electrons would go, is called the *conduction band*
 - Diamond is an insulator, because all of the electrons are in the valence band and the bandgap is large.
 
 So it is because the orbitals are just less full when bonded?
 
 ## Semiconductors
 - The band gap energy decreases rapidly with increasing atomic size
 - *silicon and germanium are not conductors they have fille valence bands and no electrons in the conduction bands*, but they are not insulators they are semiconductors
 - semiconductors conduct electricity, but not as well as metals
 - * The mechanism of conductivity involves promotion of a few electrons from the valence band to the conuction band*
 ## Binary semiconductors
 - Ga-As
 - Arsenic has a larger electronegativity than gallium, and also a larger effective nuclear charge.
 - Atomic orbitals associated with As ar lower in energy than those associated with Ga
 - so the bonding molecular orbitals are closer to the more electronegative arsenic
 - more of the arsenic atomic orbitals are ujsed in bonding
 - comparing bandgap of galium arsenide (GaAs) with that of germanium is interesting
 - Galium is larger, arsenic is smaller, the band gap of GaAs is much larger than that for germanium
 - The difference in bandgap is unlikely to be due to difference in size only, the difference in electronegativity is partially responsible
 - *Band gap decreases with increasing atomic size in a series*
 
 - Bandgap can be thought of as the energy gap between atomic orbitals in an individual atom, electrons can transfer from one band to another by absorbition or emission of light of the appropriate energy
 - Light energy can be absorbed to promote an electron from valence to conduction band
 - Light energy can be emitted when an electron is transferred from the conduction band to the valence band
 - these properties can be used in light detection and emission
 
 - injection electrons into the conduction band from a source, results in electrons jumping from the conduction band to the valence band
 - the decrease in energy associated with going from higher energy to lower energy orbitals is released in light
 - shinning light of the appropriate energy on a "reverse biased" semiconductor causes electrons to jump from the valecne to the conduction band orbitals and flow into the circut detected as current or voltage - detection of light.
 - The energy, color, region of electromagnetic spectrum these devices work in is determined by the band gap energy, which is in turn determened by the atomic size and electronegativity

 ### Ionic Structures
 Difference in electronegativites and sizes of the atoms in binary materials can result in important differences, bulk material properties that can be controlled
 - *polar bond* uneven distribution of electrons molecular orbitals larger on As antibonding orbitals larger on Ga
 - electronegativity difference resulted in weaker atomic orbital overlap
 - if the energy difference between atomic orbitals is large, then they do not mix well to form molecular orbitals, the electrons do not go down as much in energy in the new molecular orbitals.
 -  sodium chloride (NaCl), the energy difference is so large, that there is no mixing of the atomic orbitals at all, the molecular orbitals of NaCl are essentially pure sodium and chlorine atomic orbitals!
 - The valence orbitals still arrange themselves in the lowest energy orbitals, which means that the single valence electron on the sodium atom is in a pure chlorine p atomic orbital.
 - The sodium effectively completely lost one electron to become a sodium cation, and the chlorine effectively gained one electron to become a chlorine anion.
 - The structure is best described as Na+ –Cl, the sodium and chlorine have an ionic bond.
 
 ![naclorbitals](naclorbitals.png "Na+-Cl orbitals")
 
 - in the Na+ –Cl “molecule”, we don’t really have any molecular orbitals, the electrons are not delocalized and shared among nuclei, our understanding of covalent “shared electron” bonding is absent here.
 - what is it that holds the two atoms together? Actually, they are not held together strongly at all, molecular Na+ –Cl is very weakly bonded
 -  Recall, metals overcome the problem of weak bonding by getting involved in 3-D extended bonding, ionic structures such as sodium chloride do the same thing!
 this image might help me understand bandgap
 ![naclband](naclband.png "nacl band gap")
 
 - The molecular orbital description of bonding in NaCl shows that the lowest energy situation is to effectively form a positively charged sodium cation and a negatively charged chlorine ion.
 - The oppositely charged ions stabilize each other (the electron energy is decreased) in a way that is not included in a pure molecular orbital description of bonding, this is what is missing!
 - So, opposites attract, but we need to understand this in a little bit more detail than that.
 - The Coulomb law describes the energy, Ec, associated with bringing two charged particles together:
 */
let Ke = 8.987e9
function interactionEnergy(q1: Double, q2: Double, r: Double){
    Ke*(q1*q2)/r
}

/*:
 The energy is negative (i.e. the energy goes down), when the signs of the two charges, q1 and q2, are opposite
 Strictly speaking, the Coulomb law only applies to two charges, nevertheless, we can use it as a guide to understand the stabilization due to charges in 3-D extended crystalline ionic solids
 
 Melting point is a measure of how strongly the ions are held together in the crystal, the stronger the forces that hold the ions together, the larger the lattice energy the more energy is required to melt the crystal.
 The lattice energy decreases with increasing size of the halide anion, which results in, for example, decreasing melting point.
 The lattice energy also decreases with increasing size of the metal cation, resulting in, for example, decreasing melting point.
 The lattice energy increases dramatically with increasing charge on the metal cation or the anion.
